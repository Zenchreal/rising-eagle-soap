# rising-eagle-soap
Attempt to reimplement the GameSpy SOAP-based protocol for Rising Eagle, or at least enough of it so that the game launches. Currently unfinished and very hacky.

Big shout out to teknogods for https://github.com/teknogods/eaEmu which has a skeleton implemention of the API I was able to copy :)
